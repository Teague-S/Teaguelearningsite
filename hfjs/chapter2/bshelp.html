		<p>
			In this game of "Battleship" you are playing on a single row of squares. The web
			page will randomly generate a ship which is three blocks wide somewhere on this
			row. The number you input is the square you are trying to hit. You will know if
			you hit or miss, and your score will be printed when you win.
